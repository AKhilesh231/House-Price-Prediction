# House-Price-Prediction
Contrary to the widespread belief that house prices are dependent on generic factors like several bedrooms and square area of the house, etc. Generally, house buyers neglect this information. As a result, their price estimation is very different from the actual prices according to their area. In this project, we developed a house cost prediction system that is used to predict the house prices by taking different features into con-siderations like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet living, etc. For this purpose, we will use different Machine Learning techniques such as linear regression, Polynomial regression, Adaboost Regression, decision Tree and many more, where we predict and compare the accuracies produced by them.
